        'Privacy' has been an important argumentative subject since the release of data collected by the NSA with a program called Prism by Edward Snowden on June 7, 2013. This program allowed for the collection of data by the NSA through back doors from companies like Google and Facebook. Through the controlled disclosure of private information by both parties, internet users might be able to protect their privacy to some extent by trading information such as IP addresses or cookies which are small data intended to notify a website of the previous activities of a user.
